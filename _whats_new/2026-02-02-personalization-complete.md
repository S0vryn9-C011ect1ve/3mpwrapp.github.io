## 🎉 Comprehensive Personalization System - Now Live!

The 3mpwr App now learns your needs and tailors your entire experience. Set up your profile once, and watch the app customize itself to you.

### What's Personalized?

#### Home Screen
- **Role-based greetings** - "Good morning! Welcome back" for PWDs, "Thanks for supporting" for allies
- **Top 3 recommendations** - Features you need most, shown first
- **Profile completion prompt** - Direct link to finish setup if incomplete

#### Wellness Hub
- **⭐ Recommended For You** - Your selected wellness tools appear first
- **Smart highlighting** - Preferred tools shown with star icons and special borders
- **Contextual help** - Understand why each tool is recommended

#### Advocacy Hub
- **⭐ Your Advocacy Needs** - Top 5 needs from your profile
- **Prioritized content** - Legal, benefits, housing resources matched to you
- **Personalized guidance** - Clear explanations of why content is shown
