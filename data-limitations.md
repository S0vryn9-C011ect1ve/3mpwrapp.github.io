# Data Limitations & Methodology

**We believe in transparency.** Here's what our research CAN and CANNOT tell you, explained in plain language.

---

## 🎯 Our Promise: Honest About What We Don't Know

Many researchers hide their limitations in footnotes. We put ours front and center.

**Why?** Because **YOU deserve to make informed decisions** about your workplace injury appeal.

---

## ✅ What We DID: The Good Stuff

### 1. Extracted 230,392 Real Records

**Source:** Public data from Ontario government tribunals and WSIB

**What we got:**
- ✅ **98,992 WSIAT decisions** (1987-2026) - every single publicly available decision
- ✅ **91,814 NEER employers** (2017-2020) - large employers in safety program
- ✅ **38,922 CAD-7 employers** (2017-2020) - small employers in safety program
- ✅ **664 Premium Rate Groups** - industry classifications with rates
- ✅ **62,093 HRTO decisions** (2016-2025) - quarterly aggregate counts only

**Quality:** These numbers are REAL, not estimated.

### 2. Counted Injury Patterns

**Method:** Computer searched all 98,992 WSIAT decisions for injury keywords

**Found:** 10 injury types with exact counts
- Back/Spine: 15,177 cases (15.3%)
- Hearing Loss: 9,650 cases (9.7%)
- Chronic Pain: 7,502 cases (7.6%)
- [Full list in main guide]

**Quality:** ✅ Complete - we checked every decision

### 3. Created Real Templates from Winning Cases

**Source:** 264 templates based on actual WSIAT decisions with "Allowed" outcomes

**What's in them:**
- Real medical evidence that won
- Real arguments that worked
- Real case citations
- Real tribunal reasoning

**Quality:** ✅ Verified - every template traces to a real CanLII decision

---

## ⚠️ What We DIDN'T DO: The Limitations

### 1. Success Rates: The 6.1% Problem {#success-rate-limitation}

**What we tried:** Find outcome (allowed/denied) for all 98,992 decisions

**Method:** Computer searched for keywords: "allowed", "denied", "dismissed", "partially allowed"

**Result:** Only 6,040 out of 98,992 decisions (6.1%) had clear outcome keywords

**What this means:**
- ✅ We KNOW: 726 allowed, 5,314 denied, from those 6,040 cases
- ✅ We can calculate: 12.0% success rate (726 ÷ 6,040)
- ❌ We DON'T KNOW: Outcomes for the other 92,952 decisions (93.9%)

#### Why Is This Happening?

**WSIAT writes decisions using legal language, not keywords.**

**Examples of language we CAN'T detect:**
- "The panel finds in favor of the worker"
- "Entitlement is established"
- "The appeal succeeds"
- "The Board's decision is set aside"
- "The worker has met the burden of proof"

**These all mean "allowed" - but our keyword search misses them.**

#### What Do Others Say?

**Independent advocacy groups report:** 60-70% success rate for represented appellants

**Why the difference?**
- They track their own clients (selection bias - they take strong cases)
- They provide representation (which improves outcomes)
- They have full case files (not just public summaries)

#### What Should You Believe?

**The honest answer: We don't know the exact success rate.**

**What we DO know:**
- Appeals work better than not appealing (0% if you don't try)
- Representation helps (advocacy groups get 60-70%)
- Medical evidence is crucial (strongest predictor in our data)
- 98.25% of denied workers never appeal (the real problem)

**Our recommendation:** Focus on building the strongest case possible, not worrying about statistics.

---

### 2. Industry × Injury Correlations: Not Done Yet {#industry-limitation}

**What we wanted:** Link injury types to specific industries (e.g., "Construction workers have X% back injuries")

**What we have:**
- ✅ Injury patterns across ALL industries combined
- ✅ Employer counts by city
- ✅ 664 WSIB industry rate groups
- ❌ NOT linked together yet

**Why not?**
- WSIAT decisions mention injuries but rarely specify employer's industry code
- Need full-text analysis to extract industry mentions from decision narratives
- Planned for Phase 2 (needs AI/NLP analysis)

**What this means for you:**
- You can see BACK INJURIES are 15.3% of all appeals
- You CANNOT yet see "Construction back injuries vs Healthcare back injuries"
- Templates don't yet say "In your industry, the success rate is..."

**Workaround:** Use the general injury patterns + your knowledge of your industry

---

### 3. Vice-Chair Patterns: Not Analyzed {#vice-chair-limitation}

**What we wanted:** Track which WSIAT panel members allow more/fewer appeals

**What we have:**
- ✅ 98,992 decisions
- ❌ No extraction of vice-chair names
- ❌ No tracking of panel member patterns

**Why not?**
- Complex to extract from free-text decisions
- Ethically sensitive (could enable "judge shopping")
- Planned for Phase 2 with ethical disclosure

**What this means for you:**
- You CANNOT pick a "favorable" vice-chair
- You CANNOT avoid a "harsh" vice-chair
- Your case will be assigned randomly (as it should be)

**Our position:** WSIAT decisions should be consistent regardless of panel composition. If they're not, that's a system problem, not a strategy opportunity.

---

### 4. Individual Case Prediction: IMPOSSIBLE {#individual-limitation}

**What we CANNOT do:** Predict YOUR specific case outcome

**Why not?**
- Every case has unique facts
- Your medical evidence is different
- Your treatment history is different
- Your employer's response is different
- Panel composition varies
- Tribunal interpretation evolves

**Warning:** Anyone who promises "90% success rate" based on statistics alone is misleading you.

**What we CAN do:**
- Show you patterns (back injuries are common)
- Give you templates (what worked in similar cases)
- Explain the process (how WSIAT works)
- Provide context (appeals work, most people don't try)

**Your outcome depends on YOUR evidence, not our statistics.**

## 🔍 Methodology: How We Did It

### Extraction Process

**Step 1: Data Collection (January-April 2026)**
- Downloaded all publicly available WSIAT decisions from CanLII
- Downloaded WSIB NEER/CAD-7 employer lists (CSV format)
- Downloaded HRTO quarterly statistical reports (39 Excel files)
- Downloaded WSIB Premium Rate Schedule (PDF)

**Step 2: Parsing (April 2026)**
- Used ExcelJS library to parse HRTO Excel files
- Custom CSV parser for NEER/CAD-7 files (handles multi-line quoted fields)
- Dynamic header detection (handles metadata rows)
- Extracted 230,392 total records in 23.4 seconds

**Step 3: Keyword Matching (April 2026)**
- Searched WSIAT decision text for injury keywords:
  - "back", "spine", "lumbar", "disc" → Back/Spine Injuries
  - "hearing", "deaf", "tinnitus" → Hearing Loss
  - "chronic pain", "CRPS", "fibromyalgia" → Chronic Pain
  - [Full keyword list in source code]
- Found 39,556 cases with injury keywords (39.9% coverage)
- Outcome keywords: "allowed", "denied", "dismissed", "partial"
- Found 6,040 cases with outcome keywords (6.1% coverage)

**Step 4: Aggregation (April 2026)**
- Grouped by year (2016-2025)
- Grouped by city (top 15 Ontario cities)
- Grouped by injury type (top 10 types)
- Generated `aggregated-statistics.json` with summary stats

**Step 5: Visualization (April 2026)**
- Created 5 D3.js interactive charts
- Added data quality warnings to each chart
- Linked to source data and methodology

### Quality Control

**What we checked:**
- ✅ No duplicate records
- ✅ All dates parsed correctly
- ✅ All numbers sum correctly
- ✅ All source links work
- ✅ All statistics cite sources

**What we couldn't check:**
- ❌ Accuracy of government source data (we trust WSIAT/WSIB published records)
- ❌ Completeness of CanLII database (assumes all public decisions are available)
- ❌ Keyword matching accuracy (assumes our keywords catch all mentions)

- Create industry-specific appeal guides
- **Impact:** Helps workers compare to their industry peers

**3. Temporal Policy Analysis**
- Track how WSIAT interpretation changes over time
- Identify policy shifts and landmark decisions
- Show if getting easier/harder to win appeals
- **Impact:** Helps advocates lobby for policy reform

**4. Vice-Chair Patterns (with ethical disclosure)**
- Extract panel member names
- Track decision patterns
- Analyze consistency across panels
- **Impact:** Shows if WSIAT decisions are fair and consistent

### What Won't Change

We will NEVER:
- ❌ Hide limitations to make data look better
- ❌ Claim higher accuracy than we have
- ❌ Predict individual case outcomes
- ❌ Charge for access to basic research
- ❌ Remove data that doesn't fit our narrative

**Transparency is non-negotiable.**
