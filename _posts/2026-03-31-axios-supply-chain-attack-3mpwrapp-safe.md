excerpt: "3mpwrApp verified safe from the March 2026 axios compromise affecting versions 1.14.0, 1.14.1, and 0.30.4. Our workspace uses axios 1.13.6 (safe version) and has zero compromised packages."

## Immediate Status: SAFE

**3mpwrApp is completely safe from the axios supply chain attack.**

On March 27-31, 2026, the popular npm package **axios** was compromised through a maintainer account takeover. We immediately verified our dependencies and confirmed:

- Using axios 1.13.6 (safe version from February 27, 2026)
- NO compromised versions in dependency tree
- plain-crypto-js typosquatting attack: NOT present
- All user data and app functionality: SECURE

## What Happened

- **Compromised:** axios 1.14.0, 1.14.1, 0.30.4
- **Attack Vector:** Maintainer account compromise (jasonsaayman)
- **Also Affected:** plain-crypto-js 4.2.1 (typosquatting attack)
- **Current Status:** Compromised versions still marked as "latest" on npm (as of March 31)

## Our Response

1. **Immediate verification** - Confirmed no compromised packages
2. **Paused npm install** - All installations frozen until all-clear
3. **Created security runbook** - Emergency response procedures
4. **Built verification tools** - Safe package checking scripts
5. **Socket.dev ready** - Supply chain monitoring configured and ready to deploy

## When Will It Be Safe?

**Timeline Estimate:**
- **Optimistic:** 24-48 hours (April 1-2)
- **Realistic:** 3-5 days (April 3-5)
- **Conservative:** 1 week (April 7)

**Waiting for:**
1. axios team unpublishes compromised versions
2. jasonsaayman account secured/revoked
3. Official all-clear from axios project

**Monitor:**
```bash
npm view axios@latest version
# Safe when: != 1.14.0, != 1.14.1, != 0.30.4
```

## For Users: NO ACTION REQUIRED

Your data is safe. The app is not affected. Continue using 3mpwrApp normally.

## For Developers: ALL WORK HALTED

- **ALL development operations paused** until all-clear
- Do NOT run npm install or npm update
- **Stress testing delayed** - May shift by up to 2 weeks
- Use existing node_modules (verified safe)
- Run: powershell -File scripts/safe-package-verify.ps1
- Review: docs/SECURITY_INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md

**We refuse to touch the npm ecosystem while compromised packages are marked as "latest". Your security > our timeline.**

### Known Issue: Firebase Crash Notification

We received a crash report from Firebase Crashlytics on March 31, 2026:

Fatal Exception: Property 'trackEvent' doesn't exist

This analytics tracking error **will be resolved once axios is resolved** and we can safely update dependencies. The crash does not affect core app functionality or data securityit's a non-critical analytics issue that requires npm package updates to fix.

**Impact:** Analytics tracking may fail in some edge cases until we can deploy the fix (estimated April 3-5).

## Long-term Protection

Socket.dev supply chain monitoring is configured and ready to deploy:
- Real-time compromise detection
- Typosquatting alerts
- Install script monitoring
- Publisher reputation tracking

This will activate as soon as it's safe to run npm install.
