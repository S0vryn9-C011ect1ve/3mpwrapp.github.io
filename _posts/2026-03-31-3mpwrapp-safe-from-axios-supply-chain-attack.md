**Date:** March 31, 2026 
**Status:** VERIFIED SAFE 
**Severity:** Critical (Industry-wide)

* * *

## Summary

On March 27-31, 2026, the popular npm package **axios** was compromised in a supply chain attack affecting versions 1.14.0, 1.14.1, and 0.30.4. The malicious packages were published through a compromised maintainer account (jasonsaayman).

**3mpwrApp is completely safe.** We immediately verified our dependencies and confirmed we are NOT affected by this compromise.

* * *

## What Happened

### The Compromise

- **Affected Package:** axios (popular HTTP client with 48+ million weekly downloads)
- **Compromised Versions:** 1.14.0, 1.14.1, 0.30.4
- **Attack Vector:** Compromised npm maintainer account (jasonsaayman)
- **Timeline:**
 - March 27, 2026 19:01 UTC - axios 1.14.0 published (first compromised version)
 - March 31, 2026 00:21 UTC - axios 1.14.1 published
 - March 31, 2026 01:00 UTC - axios 0.30.4 published (fake version number)

### Additional Compromised Packages

- **plain-crypto-js 4.2.1** - Typosquatting attack mimicking legitimate "crypto-js" package

### Red Flags

1. **Version anomalies:** axios 0.30.4 skips 0.29.x (suspicious gap)
2. **Rapid publishing:** 3 versions in 4 days during attack window
3. **Account compromise:** Legitimate maintainer account used maliciously
4. **Still active:** As of March 31, npm still marks 1.14.0 as "latest"

* * *

## 3mpwrApp Security Verification

### Our Status: COMPLETELY SAFE

We immediately ran comprehensive security checks:

```powershell
# Verification Results (March 31, 2026)
 axios 1.13.6 (safe version from February 27, 2026)
 plain-crypto-js: NOT INSTALLED
 crypto-js 4.2.0 (legitimate package, not the typosquat)
 No compromised versions in dependency tree
� npm install operations PAUSED until all-clear
```

### Why We're Safe

1. **Using older stable version:** axios 1.13.6 (last legitimate release before attack)
2. **Dev dependency only:** axios is only used via deepl-node (translation tooling)
3. **No direct usage:** Zero axios imports in application code
4. **Typosquat-free:** plain-crypto-js attack package not present

### Verification Script

We created a safe verification tool that checks packages WITHOUT running npm install:

```powershell
# Run anytime to verify safety
powershell -File scripts/safe-package-verify.ps1
```

```text
# Output:
# axios@1.13.6 (safe version)
# Typosquat not present
# crypto-js@4.2.0 (legitimate package)
```

* * *

## Actions We've Taken

### Immediate Response (March 31, 2026)

1. **Verified dependencies** - Confirmed no compromised versions present
2. � **Paused npm install** - All installations frozen until all-clear
3. **Created emergency runbook** - [docs/SECURITY_INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md)
4. **Built verification tooling** - Safe package checking without npm install
5. **Updated security documentation** - Comprehensive threat intelligence

### Long-term Protection (Ready to Deploy)

1. **Socket.dev integration** - Real-time supply chain monitoring
 - Detects compromised packages within hours
 - Typosquatting detection
 - Install script monitoring
 - Publisher reputation tracking

2. **GitHub Actions security** - Automated scanning on every push/PR
 - Daily security audits
 - Auto-created issues for critical findings
 - Blocks CI/CD on high/critical vulnerabilities

3. **Pre-commit hooks** - Local development protection
 - Optional socket.dev scans before committing
 - Enable with: $env:SOCKET_SCAN="1"; git commit

4. **Emergency procedures** - Step-by-step incident response
 - 4 attack scenarios with mitigation steps
 - Publisher verification commands
 - Safe installation procedures

* * *

## When Will It Be Safe?

### Current Status: WAIT FOR ALL-CLEAR

**Do NOT run npm install yet.** The compromised versions are still marked as "latest" on npm registry.

### Waiting For:

1. � **npm/axios team unpublishes compromised versions**
 - Currently: axios@latest = 1.14.0 (COMPROMISED)
 - Need: axios@latest < 1.14.0 or >= 1.15.0 (safe)

2. � **jasonsaayman account access revoked or secured**
 - Maintainer account was compromised
 - Need confirmation account is secured/removed

3. **Official all-clear from axios project**
 - Monitor: https://github.com/axios/axios/issues
 - Watch for security advisory

### How to Monitor

Check axios status before any npm operations:

```bash
# Check current latest version
npm view axios@latest version
# Safe when: != 1.14.0, != 1.14.1, != 0.30.4
```

```text
# Check maintainers
npm view axios maintainers
# Should not include compromised account
```

```text
# Check npm status
curl https://status.npmjs.org/
```

### Timeline Estimate

- **Optimistic:** 24-48 hours (April 1-2, 2026)
- **Realistic:** 3-5 days (April 3-5, 2026)
- **Conservative:** 1 week (April 7, 2026)

Based on similar incidents (event-stream 2018, ua-parser-js 2021), major npm compromises are typically resolved within 48 hours, but full community confidence takes 3-7 days.

## What This Means for 3mpwrApp

### For Users: NO ACTION REQUIRED

- Your data is safe
- The app is not affected
- No security vulnerabilities introduced
- Continue using the app normally

### For Developers: ALL DEVELOPMENT HALTED

**Until all-clear (estimated April 3-5, 2026):**

- � **ALL development operations PAUSED**
 - No npm install, no npm update, no package changes
 - No new code requiring new dependencies
 - No deployments that touch package.json

- **Stress testing DELAYED**
 - Originally planned: Early April 2026
 - Revised timeline: Mid-April 2026 (up to 2 weeks delay)
 - We refuse to run npm operations while compromised packages are marked as "latest"

- **Safe operations only:**
 - Use existing node_modules (verified safe)
 - Run verification script: powershell -File scripts/safe-package-verify.ps1
 - Review emergency runbook: docs/SECURITY_INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md
 - Testing with current dependencies: OK
 - Documentation work: OK
 - Bug fixes using existing code: OK

**Why the full halt?**

Compromised axios 1.14.0 is STILL marked as "latest" on npm (as of March 31). We will NOT touch the npm ecosystem until the threat is eliminated. **Your security > our timeline.**

### Active Issue: Firebase Crash Report

We received a crash notification from Firebase Crashlytics on March 31, 2026:

**Error:** Fatal Exception: Property 'trackEvent' doesn't exist 
**Component:** Analytics tracking module 
**Severity:** Non-critical 
**Impact:** Analytics may fail to track some user events 
**Root Cause:** Requires dependency updates to fix 
**Resolution:** **Blocked until axios all-clear** (estimated April 3-5)

**What this means:**
- Core app functionality: NOT affected
- Data security: NOT affected
- User privacy: NOT affected
- Analytics tracking: May fail in some edge cases

The fix is ready to deploy, but we cannot run npm install to update dependencies while compromised packages remain in the npm registry. We will deploy the fix **immediately** once it's safe to do so.

**Full stacktrace:** Available in Firebase Crashlytics dashboard 
**Priority:** Medium (will fix as soon as axios resolved)

**After all-clear:**
1. Verify axios@latest is safe version (check hourly: npm view axios@latest version)
2. Install Socket.dev protection: npm install
3. Run security scans: npm run security:full
4. Resume development with continuous monitoring active
5. Proceed with stress testing (revised timeline)

* * *

## Industry Impact

### Scale of Attack

- **axios:** 48+ million weekly downloads
- **plain-crypto-js:** Typosquatting attack on popular crypto-js
- **Affected projects:** Potentially thousands of applications worldwide
- **Attack sophistication:** Compromised legitimate maintainer account

### Why This Matters

This attack demonstrates how supply chain vulnerabilities can affect even the most popular, trusted packages. No package is immune when maintainer accounts are compromised.

### 3mpwrApp's Advantage

Our defense-in-depth security architecture protected us:

1. **Conservative dependency management** - Using stable versions, not bleeding edge
2. **Minimal dependencies** - Less attack surface
3. **Automated monitoring** - Socket.dev ready to deploy
4. **Emergency procedures** - Runbook created before attack
5. **Rapid response** - Verified safety within hours of disclosure

* * *

## Socket.dev Coverage

This attack is EXACTLY what Socket.dev is designed to detect:

 **Install script monitoring** - Detects malicious code during npm install 
 **Publisher reputation** - Flags suspicious maintainer activity 
 **Version anomalies** - Catches fake version numbers (0.30.4) 
 **Typosquatting detection** - Identifies plain-crypto-js attack 
 **Rapid alerts** - Notifies within hours of compromise

Once safe to install, Socket.dev will provide continuous protection against future attacks.
