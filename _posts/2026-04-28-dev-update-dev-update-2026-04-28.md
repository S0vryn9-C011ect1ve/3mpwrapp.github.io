# Dev Update: What's Been Happening in 3mpwrApp

We believe in building in public. Here's a look at what our team has been working on recently, straight from our development history.

---

##  New & Improved

- Deploy 25,213 AI-predicted tribunal outcomes with 79% accuracy
- Complete 4-tribunal collection analysis via subagents
- Complete Phase 1 data collection + pipeline infographic
- BREAKTHROUGH - Official data sources bypass DataDome! WSIAT scraper for 95,298 decisions (vs 98,992 on CanLII). Includes Puppeteer fallback + full documentation of Tribunals Ontario open data.
- Add Tier C text enrichment pipeline and official tribunal scraper - target 25,895 unresolved cases with full text NLP + direct tribunal site scraping to improve outcome detection from 5-50% across all tribunals
- Add 4 major enhancements to keyword network visualization - individual tribunal views (WSIAT/HRTO/ONSBT/ONWSIB), zoom controls (in/out/reset), comprehensive keyword focus list with case counts, all Canadian provinces marked as coming soon

##  Fixes & Polish

- Add anti-bot detection to enrichment script - rotating User-Agents, browser headers, random delays, 403 retry logic
- Clarify WSIAT abandonment rate phrasing (detected outcomes context) and update Ontario coverage to 34,928 decisions across 4 tribunals - data accuracy audit corrections
- Lower default threshold to 10 and add dynamic threshold for individual tribunal views to ensure all keywords display properly

## Why We Build in Public

Transparency is a core operating principle at 3mpwrApp. The community we serve has been let down by opaque institutions - we want to be the structural opposite of that. This means sharing our development process openly, explaining what we're working on and why, and being honest when things take longer than expected.
