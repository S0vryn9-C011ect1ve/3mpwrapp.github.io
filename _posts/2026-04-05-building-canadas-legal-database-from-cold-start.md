# Building Canada's Legal Database for Injured Workers and Persons with Disabilities

## The Challenge: Beta Launch with No Legal Templates

As of April 2026, the 3mpwrApp is in **beta testing** with a critical gap: our users - injured workers and persons with disabilities - have no access to legal case templates or winning appeal strategies. 

While our beta testers can access the app's core features, they're navigating the complex WSIAT appeals process **without the roadmap that successful cases provide**.

We needed to change that.

---

## Our Mission

**Who We Serve:**
- **Injured workers** navigating workplace injury appeals (WSIAT, workers' compensation boards)
- **Persons with disabilities** seeking benefits and accommodations
- **Advocacy groups** like Thunder Bay Disabled & Injured Workers Support Group (TBDIWSG)
- **Community organizers** supporting marginalized communities

**What They Need:**
- Real examples of appeal cases that **won**
- Understanding **WHY** those cases succeeded
- **Exact arguments** that convinced tribunals
- **Medical evidence strategies** that work
- **Legal precedents** to cite in their own cases

---

## The Solution: Feeding the Three Flywheels

Our platform operates on three interconnected "flywheels" - data systems that improve with use:

### **Flywheel 1: Legal Templates Library**
Winning case templates organized by medical condition, showing exactly what worked

### **Flywheel 2: Medical Evidence Database**
Patterns of successful medical documentation (IME reports, specialist assessments, diagnostic tests)

### **Flywheel 3: Success Pattern Analysis**
AI-powered insights identifying common factors in winning appeals

**The Problem:** All three flywheels were **empty**. Cold start. No data.

**The Goal:** Build Canada's most comprehensive legal decision database for injured workers and persons with disabilities.

## Phase 1: Ontario - Building the Foundation (April 5-15, 2026)

### **Day 0 - Today: Cold Start to 4,532 Cases**

**What We Did:**
1. **Connected to CanLII API** - Canada's free legal database
2. **Scraped Ontario tribunals**: WSIAT (Workplace Safety & Insurance Appeals Tribunal), ONCA (Ontario Court of Appeal), ONHRT (Ontario Human Rights Tribunal)
3. **Collected 4,532 case IDs** spanning 1900-2026

**Initial Results:**
- ✅ 4,532 Ontario cases collected
- ✅ 228 cases with known outcomes (5%)
  - 174 Allowed (workers WON)
  - 54 Dismissed
- ❌ 4,304 cases with Unknown outcomes (95%)

**Why So Many Unknowns?**
We initially scraped only metadata (case numbers, dates, keywords) - not full decision text. It's like having book titles without the actual books.

### **Day 0 - First Templates Generated**

Despite limited data, we generated **149 initial templates** from winning cases:

**Coverage:**
- 47 different medical conditions
- Top conditions: Chronic fatigue (61), Shoulder injuries (25), Knee issues (16)
- All Ontario cases (WSIAT, ONCA, ONHRT)

**What's Included (Basic):**
- ✅ Case citations and CanLII URLs
- ✅ Conditions and outcomes
- ✅ Decision dates
- ❌ Judge reasoning (WHY cases won) - *need full text*
- ❌ Winning arguments - *need full text*
- ❌ Medical evidence details - *need full text*

**Current Value:**
Beta testers can see that appeals CAN win, find recent cases by condition, and get URLs to read full decisions manually. But they can't yet see the winning strategies.

### **Days 1-9: Priority Refetch for Complete Data**

**The Plan:**
Starting tonight (April 5, 8 PM ET), we're refetching all 4,532 Ontario cases with **full decision text** using a smart priority system:

**Priority Queue:**
- 🔴 **404 High Priority** - Unknown outcome + medical evidence keywords (Day 1)
- 🟡 **3,900 Medium Priority** - Unknown outcome (Days 2-8)
- 🟢 **228 Low Priority** - Known outcome but can improve quality (Day 9)

**How It Works:**
- Automated daily refetch at 8 PM ET (when API quota resets)
- Processes ~500 cases per day
- Extracts full judge reasoning, winning arguments, medical evidence, cited case law
- Resumable (picks up where it left off if quota exceeded)
- Safe delays (0.8-1.5s per request) to respect API limits

**Expected Daily Progress:**

| Day | Cases Processed | Total with Outcomes | Templates Ready | Quality Score |
|-----|----------------|---------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| 0 (Today) | 0 refetch | 228 (5%) | 149 basic | 62/100 |
| 1 | 404 high priority | 632 (14%) | ~550 detailed | 75/100 |
| 3 | 1,404 total | 1,332 (29%) | ~900 detailed | 78/100 |
| 5 | 2,404 total | 2,200 (49%) | ~1,200 detailed | 80/100 |
| 7 | 3,404 total | 3,100 (68%) | ~1,400 detailed | 82/100 |
| 9 | 4,404 total | 4,100 (90%) | ~1,500 detailed | 85/100 |
| 10 | 4,532 complete | 4,200+ (93%) | **1,500+ detailed** | **85-90/100** |

### **Day 10: Complete Ontario Database**

**Expected Results (April 15, 2026):**
- ✅ **4,532 Ontario cases** fully processed
- ✅ **1,500+ winning case templates** with full details
- ✅ **4,200+ cases with outcomes** (93% success rate)
- ✅ **Full judge reasoning** in every template
- ✅ **Winning arguments** extracted and categorized
- ✅ **Medical evidence patterns** identified
- ✅ **Cited case law** ready for reference
- ✅ **Thunder Bay cases** tagged and prioritized

**What Beta Testers Will Get:**
Templates that show **exactly** how to win appeals:
- Copy-ready legal arguments
- Medical evidence checklists (what reports to get)
- Precedent citations to include in appeals
- Real judge quotes explaining why evidence was compelling
- Success factors broken down by condition

4. **Community Learning** → Advocacy groups train using real data
5. **Higher Win Rates** → More injured workers and persons with disabilities succeed
6. **More Data** → Each success refines the system
7. **Cycle Repeats** → Flywheels gain momentum

## Conclusion: From Zero to Impact

**Where We Started:**
- Beta app with no legal templates
- Empty flywheels
- No data on what works for injured workers and persons with disabilities

**Where We Are (Day 0 - April 5, 2026):**
- 4,532 Ontario cases collected
- 149 basic templates generated
- Priority refetch system ready to launch tonight
- Clear path to 1,500+ detailed Ontario templates in 10 days

**Where We're Going (By June 1, 2026):**
- 14,000+ cases covering all of Canada
- 5,320+ detailed winning templates
- Full flywheel momentum
- Real impact for injured workers and persons with disabilities

**Our Commitment:**

Every injured worker and every person with a disability deserves access to the same legal strategies that help others win their appeals. This isn't just about building a database - it's about **leveling the playing field**.

When someone in Thunder Bay with chronic pain needs to appeal a WSIAT decision, they shouldn't need to hire an expensive lawyer to find out what arguments work. They should have access to 61 real examples of chronic pain cases that **won**, complete with the exact reasoning judges found compelling.

That's what we're building. That's the mission.
