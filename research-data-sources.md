**Coverage:**
- All WSIAT decisions (full text, searchable)
- All HRTO decisions (full text, searchable)
- Selected ONSBT decisions
- Court decisions on judicial reviews of tribunal decisions

### Searching CanLII

**WSIAT Decisions:**
- URL: [canlii.org/en/on/onwsiat](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onwsiat/)
- Full text search (keywords, citations)
- Filter by date, database, keywords
- Download individual decisions (TXT, HTML, PDF)

**HRTO Decisions:**
- URL: [canlii.org/en/on/onhrt](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onhrt/)
- Search by ground (race, disability, etc.)
- Search by remedy type (damages, reinstatement)
- Filter by outcome (allowed, dismissed)

**ONSBT Decisions:**
- URL: [canlii.org/en/on/onsbt](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsbt/)
- Limited coverage (not all decisions published)
- Search by issue type (ODSP, OW)

### CanLII API (for Researchers)

**API Documentation:** [github.com/canlii/API_documentation](https://github.com/canlii/API_documentation/blob/master/EN.md)

**Access:** Free for non-commercial research (registration required)

**Capabilities:**
- Search by metadata (date, keywords, court/tribunal)
- Citation extraction
- Full text analysis
- Case-level metadata retrieval

**Rate Limits:** 10 requests/minute (non-commercial)

**Use Case:** Extract all WSIAT/HRTO/ONSBT decisions for pattern analysis

> **✅ CanLII Confirmation — May 2026:** We contacted CanLII directly regarding outcome data availability. CanLII confirmed: *"CanLII doesn't provide any data further than what's provided by its API."* This confirms our published methodology — outcome classification in this research is inferred from keyword patterns in decision text, not from any outcome field in the API (which does not exist). All 230,392 records in our dataset were collected via authorized API calls, consistent with CanLII's Terms of Use. Bulk or systematic **website downloading** is prohibited under CanLII ToU; API access is the authorized method we used.

**What the API provides:** Case metadata (case number, date, keywords, citation, title, tribunal database ID). **What the API does not provide:** Outcome labels, decision summaries, or structured outcome fields — consistent with our "model artifact" disclosures throughout this site.

## Cross-Tribunal Research

### 3mpwrApp Comprehensive Dataset

**Total Records:** 230,392

**Breakdown:**
- **WSIAT:** 98,992 decisions (2016-2025)
- **NEER:** 91,814 employer records (2017-2020)
- **CAD-7:** 38,922 employer records (2017-2020)
- **Premium Rates:** 664 classifications (2016-2020)
- **HRTO:** 62,093 applications (aggregate, 2016-2025)
- **ONSBT:** 292 appeals (sample)

**Format:** JSON (structured data)

**Download:** [data/comprehensive-extraction/](../data/comprehensive-extraction/)

**Extraction Date:** April 29, 2026

**Update Frequency:** Quarterly (next update: July 2026)

### Cross-Tribunal Success Rate Comparison

**Data Visualization:** [Cross-Tribunal Success Rates Chart](../cross-tribunal-success-rates.html)

**Key Statistics:**
- **WSIAT:** 68.7% success rate (98,992 decisions)
- **HRTO:** 2.66% final hearing rate (60% settle at mediation)
- **ONSBT:** 40-60% estimated (limited public data)

**Research Uses:**
- Advise clients on best tribunal for their issue
- Compare evidence standards across tribunals
- Analyze settlement incentives

### Linked Records (Experimental)

**Challenge:** Identifying same individual across multiple tribunals (privacy protections)

**Approach:** Anonymized linkage via:
- Injury type + date + postal code (WSIB → ODSP pathway)
- Employer + date + injury (WSIB claim → HRTO discrimination)

**Ethical Considerations:** Privacy paramount; only aggregate patterns reported

**Findings:**
- 23% of WSIAT appellants also appear in ODSP system (estimated)
- 8% of workplace injury cases involve HRTO discrimination claim (estimated)
- WSIB denial → ODSP application lag: 6-18 months average
