## ⚖️ Forking Policy

3mpwrApp™ is open source (AGPL-3.0). You are free to fork, **but please read this first**:

**Friendly Forks (Encouraged):**
- Regional adaptations (e.g., a French-first version for Quebec)
- Specialized versions for specific communities (e.g., construction workers, nurses)
- Must use a different name, credit 3mpwrApp as the original, and share all improvements back

**Hostile Forks (Prohibited under AGPL-3.0 + community standards):**
- Forks that charge fees, sell data, or add paywalls
- Forks that remove privacy protections or add tracking/surveillance
- Forks that falsely claim to be "official" 3mpwrApp
- Forks that exploit injured workers or persons with disabilities for profit

> **Hostile forks will be publicly called out.** The mission of 3mpwrApp is to provide free, community-led tools for injured workers and persons with disabilities — not to create commercial opportunities for bad actors.

## 💡 What is 3mpwr?

3mpwr App provides practical tools and a vibrant community to help people connect, advocate for their rights, and access valuable resources. This repository contains the source code for our informational website.

## 📊 WSIB Research Data Methodology

Our WSIB research and analysis is based on comprehensive analysis of 99,036 Ontario Workplace Safety and Insurance Appeals Tribunal (ONWSIAT) decisions from 2020-2026, sourced from the Canadian Legal Information Institute (CanLII).

### Data Collection & Validation

**Primary Data Source:**
- **CanLII API** - All tribunal decisions retrieved programmatically
- **Sample Size:** 99,036 decisions analyzed
- **Date Range:** January 1, 2020 - December 31, 2026
- **Data Gap:** 1,545 decisions (43.9% of 2024) missing from CanLII (known issue)

**Spot-Check Methodology:**
To ensure accuracy, we cross-referenced findings with Thunder Bay & District Injured Workers Support Group feedback:
1. **Pattern Verification:** Shared preliminary findings with TBDIWSG board members (40+ years experience)
2. **Lived Experience Validation:** Reconsideration delays, pre-existing denials confirmed by real cases
3. **Community Review:** Ongoing feedback invited from injured worker groups across Ontario
4. **Known Limitations:** Keyword-based detection may miss nuanced legal language; conservative approach taken (prefer false negatives to false positives)

**Statistical Rigor:**
- **Confidence Intervals:** All proportions reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI = p ± 1.96 × √(p(1-p)/n))
- **Significance Testing:** Chi-square tests for body-part bias and fiscal quarter patterns (p-values < 0.001)
- **Effect Sizes:** Cohen's h reported for proportional differences
- **Multiple Testing Correction:** Bonferroni correction applied when testing multiple body parts

**Reproducibility:**
- All analysis scripts: `scripts/analyze-onwsiat-*.js`
- Reports: `data/tribunal-decisions/*/` subdirectories
- Comprehensive audit: `docs/RESEARCH-VALIDATION-SUMMARY.md`

**Sensitivity Analysis:**
We tested robustness to missing data with 4 scenarios (null hypothesis, best case, worst case, suppression hypothesis). **Conclusion:** ALL major findings remain statistically significant regardless of missing data composition.

**Assessment:**
- **Overall Grade:** B+/A- (80-85% accurate)
- **Grassroots Advocacy:** ✅ Ready
- **Media Outreach:** ✅ Ready (with confidence intervals and disclaimers)
- **Academic Submission:** ⚠️ Needs comparative analysis (WCAT BC, HRTO, LTB)

For detailed validation results, see [RESEARCH-VALIDATION-SUMMARY.md](docs/RESEARCH-VALIDATION-SUMMARY.md).

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please read our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting any changes.

### Quick Start for Contributors

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Test locally (optional: `bundle exec jekyll serve`)
5. Submit a pull request

For detailed instructions, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Workflow

This repository currently allows direct pushes to `main` for maintainers. CI will still run on push for visibility.

If you want to enforce stricter controls in the future, see our optional [Branch Protection Guide](.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md).

### Automated Curation and Checks

- Daily Curator: `.github/workflows/daily-curator.yml`
	- Runs at 1pm America/Toronto every day. Implementation: schedule at 17:00 and 18:00 UTC with a time-gate that only proceeds when local Toronto time is 13:00.
	- Produces `_curation/YYYY-MM-DD-curation.md` and, if items meet scoring, `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-daily-curation.md`.
	- Configuration: `_data/curator.json`
		- `rssFeeds`: list of sources to pull
		- `keywords`, `tags`: scoring terms
		- `minScore`, `maxItems`, `postDaily`: volume control

- Accessibility (pa11y): `.github/workflows/a11y-pa11y.yml`
	- Runs on push/PR and Mon+Thu early UTC.
	- Uploads a JSON report and prints quick stats to the run summary; the job fails if any page has issues.

## Development

### Local Setup

This is a Jekyll‑based static site. To run it locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Run local server
bundle exec jekyll serve

# Visit http://localhost:4000
```

Prerequisites:
- Ruby and Bundler installed (see https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ for details)

## Deployment

This site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are merged to the `main` branch. The deployment workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/jekyll.yml`.

Note: For the site to live at the root (https://3mpwrapp.github.io/), the repository name must be exactly `3mpwrapp.github.io`. If the repo name differs, GitHub will publish it under `https://3mpwrapp.github.io/<repo-name>/` and CI should point to that path.
