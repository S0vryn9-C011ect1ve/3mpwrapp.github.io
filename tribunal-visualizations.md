# Tribunal Data Visualizations

*Exploring 230,392 records from Ontario's workplace injury and human rights systems*

## Overview

This research network provides interactive visualizations based on comprehensive data extraction from:
- **98,992 WSIAT decisions** (2016-2025)
- **91,814 NEER employer safety records** (2017-2020)
- **38,922 CAD-7 small employer records** (2017-2020)
- **664 premium rate classifications** (2016-2020)
- **62,093 HRTO applications** (quarterly aggregates, 2016-2025)
- **292 ONSBT appeals** (analyzed sample)

For ONWSIB-specific visuals and summaries, use the reconciled 2020-2026 archive of **463 internal review decisions**. Public outcome visibility remains limited: **95.7% unresolved**, so any apparent ONWSIB win-rate figure should be read as a **classified-only subset snapshot**, not a system-wide success rate.

## Interactive Visualizations

### 1. Cross-Tribunal Success Rate Comparison

**What It Shows:** Appeal success rates across Ontario's three major tribunals

**Key Findings:**
- WSIAT: 68.7% success rate (98,992 decisions)
