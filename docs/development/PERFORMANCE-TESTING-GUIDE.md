## 🔧 DETAILED PERFORMANCE CHECKS

### Check Image Optimization
1. Open DevTools Network tab
2. Filter by Images
3. For each image:
   - [ ] File size reasonable (<100KB each)
   - [ ] Format optimized (WebP, JPEG, PNG)
   - [ ] Dimensions match display size
   - [ ] No unnecessary high-DPI versions

### Check CSS & JavaScript
1. DevTools Network tab
2. Filter by CSS/JS
3. For each file:
   - [ ] Minified (looks compressed)
   - [ ] Reasonable size
   - [ ] Cacheable (has far-future expires)
   - [ ] Not render-blocking if possible

### Check Fonts
1. DevTools Network tab
2. Filter by font files
3. For each font:
   - [ ] Loaded from fast source (CDN)
   - [ ] Font-display: swap (avoids flash)
   - [ ] Subset fonts if needed
   - [ ] Not too many font variants

### Check Third-Party Scripts
1. DevTools Network tab
2. Identify third-party domains
3. For each:
   - [ ] Is it necessary?
   - [ ] Could it be deferred?
   - [ ] Is it from fast CDN?
   - [ ] Is it cached?

---

## 📱 MOBILE PERFORMANCE CHECK

### Throttling
1. DevTools → Network tab
2. Change from "No throttling" to:
   - [ ] "Slow 4G"
   - [ ] "Fast 3G"
3. Hard refresh and observe

### Check Mobile-Specific Issues
- [ ] Fonts responsive (readable on small screen)
- [ ] Touch targets adequate (44x44px minimum)
- [ ] Viewport meta tag present
- [ ] No horizontal scroll
- [ ] No huge images for mobile

### Test on Real Device (if possible)
- [ ] Open site on phone/tablet
- [ ] Check performance over cellular
- [ ] Check responsiveness
- [ ] Test touch interactions

---

## 🔐 SECURITY HEADERS IMPACT

Headers that might affect performance:
- [ ] Content-Security-Policy
- [ ] Subresource Integrity (SRI)
- [ ] HSTS

These shouldn't cause issues but verify they're not blocking critical resources.

---

## 🔄 CACHING ANALYSIS

### Browser Cache
1. DevTools → Network
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Note all file sizes in "transferred"
4. Soft refresh (Ctrl+R)
5. Check if files are served from cache (smaller or 0B)

### Expected Results
- CSS/JS: Cached (0B, gray text)
- Images: Cached (0B, gray text)
- HTML: Usually not cached or short cache

### Cache Headers Check
1. Click on response header
2. Look for:
   - [ ] `Cache-Control: max-age=...`
   - [ ] `ETag: ...` (for validation)
   - [ ] `Last-Modified: ...`

### Recommendations
- Cache static assets for 1 month: `max-age=2592000`
- Cache HTML for short time: `max-age=300`
- Cache API responses based on update frequency

## 📡 API PERFORMANCE

### Test Curation Endpoint
1. Open DevTools Network
2. Visit: https://3mpwrapp.ca/curation-latest.json
3. Check:
   - [ ] Load time: < 500ms
   - [ ] File size: < 100KB
   - [ ] Response format: Valid JSON
   - [ ] Status: 200 OK

### Check Compression
1. Response headers
2. Look for: `Content-Encoding: gzip` (or brotli)
3. Compare "Size" vs "transferred"
4. Should be significantly smaller
