### Mobile Optimizations
- Single column card grids

## Dark Mode Support

### Implementation
- CSS `prefers-color-scheme: dark` media query

- Consistent dark mode across all pages

### Color Adjustments
- Light backgrounds → Dark backgrounds
- Dark text → Light text
- Bright gradients → Muted gradients

## Performance Optimizations

### Loading Strategy
- External CSS/JS files for caching
- Deferred JavaScript loading (`defer` attribute)

- Minimal inline styles/scripts

### Animation Performance

- `will-change` for smooth animations
- `prefers-reduced-motion` media query support
- RequestAnimationFrame for scroll events

### File Organization
