## ⚠️ Known Issue: `user-guide.md`

### The Problem
The file was corrupted when it was first created. It has:
- Duplicate frontmatter fields mixed together
- Text with no spaces between words
- Content jumbled throughout the file

**Example of corruption:**
```
### ✨ Disability Wizard - Your Personal Guide**Quick start? Jump to [Getting Started in 5 Minutes](#getting-started-in-5-minutes)**phase2Features: Disability Wizard
```

Should be:
```
### ✨ Disability Wizard - Your Personal Guide

**Quick start? Jump to [Getting Started in 5 Minutes](#getting-started-in-5-minutes)**
```

### Why This Happened
When you originally provided the Phase 2 user guide content, it may have had formatting issues that caused the YAML frontmatter and content to merge together.

### The Solution
**Option 1: I can create a clean minimal version now**
- Basic structure
- Clean frontmatter
- Links to download full guide
- You can expand it later

**Option 2: You provide the source again**
- If you have the original document
- I'll import it carefully this time
- Make sure formatting is clean

**Option 3: Leave it for now, site still works**
- The `/user-guide/` page will be broken
- But homepage, about, features all work
- Can fix user guide later

| Page | URL | Status |
|------|-----|--------|
| Homepage | `https://3mpwrapp.ca` | ✅ WORKING |
| About | `https://3mpwrapp.ca/about` | ✅ WORKING (just fixed) |

## 🎯 About Those Other Deployments

### What You Saw: `https://7314eccf.3mpwrapp.pages.dev`

This is a **preview deployment** - Cloudflare creates these automatically for testing.

### The Problem
- Preview deployments are **temporary test versions**
- They're NOT meant for public use
- They often look broken or incomplete
- They have random codes like `7314eccf`, `abc123`, etc.

### Your Real Site
**Always use:** `https://3mpwrapp.ca`  
(No random code!)

This is your **production site** - the real, live version.

## 🧹 What to Do About Preview Deployments

### 🎯 Recommended: DISABLE THEM

**Why disable:**
- You're working solo (no team to review)
- You push directly to main branch
- Previews just create confusion
- Every push goes live anyway

**How to disable:**
1. Log into Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Click **Workers & Pages** (left sidebar)
3. Click **3mpwrapp** project
4. Click **Settings** tab
5. Scroll to **Builds & deployments**
6. Under **Preview deployments**, select **"None"**
7. Click **Save**

**Result:**
- ✅ No more confusing URLs like `7314eccf.3mpwrapp.pages.dev`
- ✅ Only `3mpwrapp.pages.dev` exists
- ✅ Simpler and cleaner
- ✅ Less confusion

### Alternative: Leave Them (They Auto-Delete)
- Preview deployments auto-delete after 30 days
- Just ignore them
- Always use `3mpwrapp.pages.dev`

### Manual Cleanup
If you want to delete old previews now:
1. Cloudflare Dashboard → Workers & Pages → 3mpwrapp
2. Click "View all deployments"
3. For each preview (ones with random codes):
   - Click the ⋮ (three dots) menu
   - Click "Delete deployment"

**But honestly:** Just disable them entirely to avoid future confusion.

## 📋 Your Options for User Guide

### Option A: Create Minimal Version (Fast - 5 minutes)
I can create a clean, simple user guide page with:
- Proper frontmatter
- Basic getting started info
- Links to features
- Contact information

**Pros:** Site fully functional quickly  
**Cons:** Not as comprehensive as original

### Option B: Provide Source Again (Best - 30 minutes)
If you have the original Phase 2 user guide document:
- Share it again
- I'll carefully import it with proper formatting
- Full comprehensive guide restored

**Pros:** Complete, professional guide  
**Cons:** Requires you to find/share source

### Option C: Leave It For Now (Instant)
- Keep user-guide.md as-is (broken)
- Page will 404
- Fix it later when you have time
- Rest of site works fine

**Pros:** Move forward with other priorities  
**Cons:** Broken link on your site

## 🎯 My Recommendation

**Do these in order:**

### Now (5 minutes)
1. ⏰ **Wait 8 minutes** for current deployment to finish
2. 🧪 **Test in incognito**: `https://3mpwrapp.ca`
3. ✅ **Verify** homepage, about, features work

### After Testing (10 minutes)
4. 🧹 **Disable preview deployments** in Cloudflare
   - Settings → Builds & deployments → Preview deployments → None
   - Prevents future confusion with random URLs

### For User Guide (Your Choice)
5. **Option A**: I create minimal version now (fast, works)
6. **Option B**: You provide source, I import properly (best, takes longer)
7. **Option C**: Leave it, fix later (easiest now)
