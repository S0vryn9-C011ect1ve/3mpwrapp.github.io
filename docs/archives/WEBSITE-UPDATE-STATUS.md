## ✅ Issue 2: Roadmap IS in Navigation Menu

### What You Said:
> "i dont see roadmap in menu on website"

### ✅ ALREADY THERE - Just Needs Cache Clear

**Status**: Roadmap link is in `_layouts/default.html` at lines 90-94:

```html
<li>
  <a href="{{ lang_prefix | append: '/roadmap' | relative_url }}" 
     {% if page.url contains '/roadmap' %}aria-current="page"{% endif %}>
    {% if page.lang == 'fr' %}Feuille de route{% else %}Roadmap{% endif %}
  </a>
</li>
```

**Position in Navigation:**
1. Home
2. About
3. Features
4. User Guide
5. **Roadmap** ← HERE (between User Guide and Contact)
6. Contact
7. Blog
8. Newsletter
9. What's New
10. Beta Test
11. Search
12. Events
13. Site Map
14. FAQ
15. Accessibility Settings

### Why You Don't See It:

**Browser cache is showing old version!** The roadmap link was added in commit e891fe1 on Oct 18.

### How to Fix (See Roadmap in Menu):

#### Option 1: Hard Refresh (Fastest)
- **Chrome/Edge**: Ctrl + Shift + R (or Cmd + Shift + R on Mac)
- **Firefox**: Ctrl + F5 (or Cmd + Shift + R on Mac)
- **Safari**: Cmd + Option + R

#### Option 2: Clear Browser Cache
1. Open browser settings
2. Privacy/Security → Clear browsing data
3. Check "Cached images and files"
4. Clear last 24 hours
5. Refresh https://3mpwrapp.ca

#### Option 3: Incognito/Private Window
- Open new private/incognito window
- Visit https://3mpwrapp.ca
- Should see Roadmap link immediately

#### Option 4: Wait for Cloudflare Cache
- Cloudflare Pages cache expires automatically
- Usually within 1-4 hours
- Your site will show updated navigation once cache clears

### To Verify It's Working:
1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl + Shift + R)
2. Look for navigation menu
3. Should see "Roadmap" between "User Guide" and "Contact"
4. Click it → Should go to https://3mpwrapp.ca/roadmap

**The roadmap page exists and is live** - just need to clear your browser cache to see the updated navigation!

## ⚠️ Issue 3: Logo NOT Updated (Needs Action)

### What You Said:
> "i dont see logo update on website"

### ⚠️ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

**Issue**: The new logo image was never actually saved to the file system.

**What happened:**
1. ✅ Old logo was backed up to `assets/empowrapp-logo-old.png`
2. ✅ PWA icons were generated (12 files)
3. ❌ New logo file was never saved as `assets/empowrapp-logo.png`

**Evidence:**
```
Current logo:   empowrapp-logo.png (1,147,210 bytes, Oct 4)
Backup logo:    empowrapp-logo-old.png (1,147,210 bytes, Oct 4)
                ↑ Same file! No update happened.
```

**Why**: When you attached the new logo image in the previous conversation, I created the backup and generated icons from the OLD logo (because the new one wasn't saved first). The attachment wasn't accessible to save to the file system.

### How to Fix the Logo:

You have **3 options**:

#### Option 1: Re-attach and I'll Save It (Recommended)
1. Re-attach your new logo image (power button with hands design)
2. I'll save it as `assets/empowrapp-logo.png`
3. Then regenerate the 12 PWA icons from the new logo
4. Commit and push

#### Option 2: Manual Upload
1. Save your new logo as `empowrapp-logo.png`
2. Replace the file in `assets/` folder
3. Run: `node scripts/generate-icons.js` (regenerates all PWA icons)
4. Commit and push

#### Option 3: Keep Current Logo for Now
- Current logo is professional and works well
- Update logo later when you have time
- Focus on content and features first

### What Needs to Happen:

**If you want the new logo:**
1. Save new image as `assets/empowrapp-logo.png`
2. Run icon generator: `node scripts/generate-icons.js`
3. Commit: `git add assets/`
4. Push: `git push origin main`
5. Clear browser cache to see changes

**New logo will appear:**
- In header (top-left, 28x28px)
- In PWA manifest (all icon sizes)
- On mobile home screen when installed
- In browser tabs (favicon)
