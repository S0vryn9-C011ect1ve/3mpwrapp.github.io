## 🛑 STOPPING AGENTS

### Stop All Agents
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C in the terminal where agents are running
# OR kill the process

# Find process
ps aux | grep agent-orchestrator

# Kill it
kill <PID>

# Or more forcefully
pkill -f agent-orchestrator
```

### Restart Agents
```bash
npm run deploy:agents
```

---

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not found"
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if set
echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# If empty, set it
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

# Verify
echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

### Issue: "Cannot find module 'rss-parser'"
**Solution**:
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Issue: "Error parsing RSS feed"
**This is normal**. Some feeds occasionally timeout or change format.
- Agents handle this gracefully
- Continue processing other feeds
- Check logs for details

### Issue: "AI content generation slow"
**This is normal on first run**. Claude API takes 5-10 seconds per post.
- First post: ~15 seconds
- Subsequent posts: ~10 seconds
- Check logs to see progress

### Issue: Agents stop after a few posts
**Check for errors**:
```bash
# Look for error messages in logs
tail -f logs/agents/

# Check API key is still valid
# Check API rate limits (Claude has limits)
```

## 🔄 CONTINUOUS OPERATION

### Running in Background (Linux/Mac)
```bash
# Run in background with nohup
nohup npm run deploy:agents > agent-output.log 2>&1 &

# Check it's running
ps aux | grep agent-orchestrator

# View output
tail -f agent-output.log
```

### Running in Background (Windows PowerShell)
```powershell
# Run in background
Start-Process node -ArgumentList "scripts/agent-orchestrator.js deploy" -WindowStyle Hidden

# Check running
Get-Process node

# Stop
Stop-Process -Name node
```

### Using PM2 (Recommended for Production)
```bash
# Install PM2
npm install -g pm2

# Start agents with PM2
pm2 start scripts/agent-orchestrator.js --name "content-agents"

# Monitor
pm2 monit

# View logs
pm2 logs

# Stop
pm2 stop content-agents

# Restart
pm2 restart content-agents

# Auto-restart on reboot
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

## Orchestrator Directive

- Role: You are the orchestrator; subagents execute.
- Do not build, verify, or code inline. Your job is to plan, prioritize, and coordinate.
- Pre-task requirement: Before starting any task, read the full project context and check what other agents have completed relevant to each subagent's prompt.

Model / runtime notes (informational):

- Install / use: `kimi k`
- Install / use: `deepseek v3.2`
- Install / use: `qwen3.5-397b`

Add these notes to onboarding or deployment scripts so subagents know which models to request or expect.
