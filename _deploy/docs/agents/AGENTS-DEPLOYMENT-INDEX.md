## Orchestrator Directive

- Role: You are the orchestrator; subagents execute.
- Do not build, verify, or code inline. Your job is to plan, prioritize, and coordinate.
- Pre-task requirement: Before starting any task, read the full project context and check what other agents have completed relevant to each subagent's prompt.

Model / runtime notes (informational):

- Install / use: `kimi k`
- Install / use: `deepseek v3.2`
- Install / use: `qwen3.5-397b`

Add these notes to onboarding or deployment scripts so subagents know which models to request or expect.
