MASTODON (9:00 AM EST):
🔄 FROM ISOLATED STRUGGLES TO COLLECTIVE POWER

On March 31, we presented the "3 Flywheels of Change" to Thunder Bay injured workers. 
Three brilliant audience questions solved our biggest challenge: the cold start problem.

🎯 THE PILOT (April-June 2026):
• 500+ tribunal decisions (WSIAT, SST, HRTO)
• Pattern detection for Thunder Bay industries
• Templates from 15 years of winning cases
• Test with 5-10 real clients
• $0 cost to TBDIWSG

🚀 THE VISION:
User #1 used to need 40 hours to research an appeal.
WITH historical data: 30 minutes.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### Why This Approach Works at $0 Budget

**Traditional Approach (Not Used):**
- ❌ GPT-4 API for extraction: $0.02/case × 10,000 = $200
- ❌ ML training: Requires GPU, labeled data, expertise
- ❌ Manual data entry: 40 hours × $50/hr = $2,000

**Our Approach (Implemented):**
- ✅ Free CanLII API
- ✅ Regex extraction (pattern matching, no AI cost)
- ✅ Python standard library (requests, json, re)
- ✅ GitHub Actions (free for public repos)
- ✅ Cloudflare Pages (free hosting)

**Total Cost: $0. No compromises on functionality.**

---

### Data Quality Strategy

**Regex Extraction Accuracy:**
- Condition: ~75% accuracy (validates manually)
- Outcome: ~90% accuracy (clear legal language)
- Evidence: ~70% accuracy (some terminology variations)
- Key factors: ~60% accuracy (nuanced language)

**Validation Plan:**
1. Manual spot-check of 50 decisions (10% sample)
2. TBDIWSG validates patterns match their experience
3. Client testing reveals template usefulness
4. Iterate regex if accuracy <70% threshold

**Acceptable for Pilot:** YES
- Proof of concept doesn't require 100% accuracy
- 70-75% is enough to detect major patterns
- Can enhance with GPT-4 later if grant funding allows

---

### Automation Architecture

**GitHub Actions Workflows:**
1. `flywheels-updates.yml` - Social media posts (Tue/Fri)
2. `campaign-promo.yml` - Campaign posts (Tue/Fri)
3. `daily-feature.yml` - Daily content (10 AM)

**Integration Strategy:**
- Flywheels posts at 8:30 AM (after campaign posts at 8 AM)
- Friday educational posts at 11 AM (different time slot)
- No conflicts, complementary content

**Content Rotation:**
- 7+ pre-written posts in `post-flywheels-update.js`
- Automatic selection based on day of week
- State file tracks what's been posted
- Manual override available via workflow_dispatch

## 🎯 Definition of Success

**Pilot is successful if:**
1. ✅ 80%+ client satisfaction - "This helped me"
2. ✅ 50%+ time savings - Research time cut in half
3. ✅ 70%+ pattern accuracy - TBDIWSG confirms patterns match reality
4. ✅ 60%+ template usage - Clients actually use the templates
5. ✅ At least 1 campaign launched - Proven collective action potential

**If successful → Scale to:**
- Full Thunder Bay deployment (all TBDIWSG clients)
- Other Northern Ontario advocacy groups
- Province-wide injured worker organizations
- National expansion

**If unsuccessful → Learn:**
- Which patterns were inaccurate (refine regex)
- What templates didn't work (improve content)
- Why clients didn't use it (UX improvements)
- Iterate and retest
