## 📋 SECURITY HEADERS (30 minutes)

### Check Headers Method 1: Chrome DevTools
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Reload page
4. Click on main document request
5. Go to Response Headers
6. Look for security headers

### Check Headers Method 2: Online Tool
- Use: https://securityheaders.com
- Enter: https://3mpwrapp.ca
- Review all security headers

### Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
- [ ] Header present: `Content-Security-Policy`
- [ ] Review policy (should be restrictive)
- [ ] Check for `unsafe-inline` (not ideal but may be needed)
- [ ] Check for `unsafe-eval` (should not be present)
- [ ] Examples of good CSP:
  ```
  default-src 'self'; 
  script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; 
  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
  img-src 'self' data: https:;
  ```

### X-Frame-Options
- [ ] Header present: `X-Frame-Options`
- [ ] Value should be: `DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN`
- [ ] Prevents clickjacking attacks

### X-Content-Type-Options
- [ ] Header present: `X-Content-Type-Options`
- [ ] Value should be: `nosniff`
- [ ] Prevents MIME-sniffing attacks

### Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- [ ] Header present: `Strict-Transport-Security`
- [ ] Max-age should be reasonable (e.g., 31536000 = 1 year)
- [ ] Should include `includeSubDomains`

### Referrer-Policy
- [ ] Header present (optional but good)
- [ ] Value should be: `strict-no-referrer` or `no-referrer`

### Permissions-Policy (Feature-Policy)
- [ ] Header present (optional but good)
- [ ] Restricts browser features
- [ ] Example: `geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()`

## 🔐 CORS CONFIGURATION (20 minutes)

### Test CORS Headers
1. Open DevTools Console
2. Run test:
```javascript
fetch('https://3mpwrapp.ca/api/curation-latest.json')
  .then(r => {
    console.log('Status:', r.status);
    console.log('Headers:');
    console.log('Access-Control-Allow-Origin:', r.headers.get('Access-Control-Allow-Origin'));
    console.log('Access-Control-Allow-Methods:', r.headers.get('Access-Control-Allow-Methods'));
    return r.json();
  })
  .then(d => console.log('Data:', d))
  .catch(e => console.error('Error:', e));
```

### CORS Verification
- [ ] Check for `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header
- [ ] Should be:
  - [ ] Specific domain (e.g., `https://mastodon.social`)
  - [ ] Or `*` if public API
  - [ ] NOT empty or missing
- [ ] Check `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`
  - [ ] Should list allowed methods (GET, POST, etc.)
  - [ ] Should NOT include `*` (too permissive)
- [ ] Check `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`
  - [ ] Should be `false` unless needed
  - [ ] If `true`, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` must NOT be `*`

### Test from Different Origin
1. Open browser console
2. Try to fetch from different domain
3. Should either:
   - [ ] Return data (if CORS allows)
   - [ ] Show CORS error (if properly restricted)
4. Error is good (means CORS working)

---

## 🍪 COOKIE SECURITY (15 minutes)

### Cookie Check via DevTools
1. Open DevTools
2. Go to Application tab
3. Click Cookies (left sidebar)
4. Select domain: 3mpwrapp.pages.dev

### For Each Cookie, Verify:
- [ ] Name: (what is it?)
- [ ] Value: (does not contain sensitive data)
- [ ] Domain: (correct domain)
- [ ] Path: (appropriate path)
- [ ] Expires/Max-Age: (reasonable duration)
- [ ] **HttpOnly:** ✅ Should be checked (prevents JS access)
- [ ] **Secure:** ✅ Should be checked (HTTPS only)
- [ ] **SameSite:** Should be:
  - [ ] `Strict` (most secure - recommended)
  - [ ] Or `Lax` (good compromise)
  - [ ] NOT `None` without Secure flag

### Test Cookie Security
```javascript
// In console, check cookie flags:
document.cookie
// Should show cookies (if any are not HttpOnly)

// Try to set insecure cookie (should fail in HTTPS):
document.cookie = "test=value"; 
// This will work but shown as problem if not Secure/SameSite
```

### Recommendations
- [ ] All sensitive cookies have HttpOnly flag
- [ ] All cookies have Secure flag (HTTPS only)
- [ ] All cookies have SameSite=Strict or Lax
- [ ] No sensitive data in cookie values
- [ ] Reasonable expiration times

---

## 📝 FORM SECURITY (20 minutes)

### CSRF Protection
- [ ] Look for contact/comment forms
- [ ] Check for hidden CSRF token field
- [ ] Open DevTools → Elements tab
- [ ] Inspect form:
```html
<form ...>
  <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="...">
  <!-- or -->
  <input type="hidden" name="_token" value="...">
</form>
```

### Form Validation
1. Try each form on the site
2. For each form field:
   - [ ] Try submitting empty
   - [ ] Try invalid data (e.g., bad email)
   - [ ] Try HTML/script injection: `<script>alert('xss')</script>`
   - [ ] Try SQL injection: `'; DROP TABLE users; --`
3. Verify:
   - [ ] Client-side validation works
   - [ ] Error messages are clear
   - [ ] Dangerous input is rejected

### File Upload (if applicable)
- [ ] Try uploading executable (.exe, .sh, etc.)
- [ ] Should be rejected
- [ ] Try uploading image with HTML extension
- [ ] Should be rejected or served as download
- [ ] File type validation working

---

## 🔍 XSS VULNERABILITY CHECK (20 minutes)

### Test Injection Points
1. Search/input fields
2. URL parameters
3. Comments (if applicable)
4. User submissions

### Test Cases for Each Field
Try these payloads:
```
<!-- Test 1: Basic alert -->
<script>alert('XSS')</script>

<!-- Test 2: Event handler -->
<img src=x onerror="alert('XSS')">

<!-- Test 3: SVG -->
<svg onload="alert('XSS')">

<!-- Test 4: Data attribute -->
<div data-x="alert('XSS')">Test</div>

<!-- Test 5: HTML entity -->
&#60;script&#62;alert('XSS')&#60;/script&#62;
```

### Expected Results
- [ ] Payloads are NOT executed
- [ ] Payloads are either:
  - [ ] Encoded as text (safe)
  - [ ] Rejected
  - [ ] Stripped of dangerous parts
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] No alerts/popups

---

## 💉 SQL INJECTION CHECK (15 minutes)

### SQL Injection Tests
Try these in search/input fields:
```
<!-- Basic test -->
' OR '1'='1

<!-- Union test -->
' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL --

<!-- Comment test -->
' OR 1=1 --

<!-- Boolean test -->
' AND 1=1
' AND 1=2
```

### Expected Results
- [ ] No SQL errors in response
- [ ] No database data leaked
- [ ] Query results unaffected
- [ ] Fields sanitized/parameterized
- [ ] Injection attempts logged (ideally)

### How to Verify
1. Check if response changes based on payload
2. If response is identical for all payloads: ✅ Good (injection prevented)
3. If response changes: ❌ Problem (may be vulnerable)

---

## 🔐 AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION (10 minutes)

### Check Authentication
- [ ] Sensitive pages require login (if applicable)
- [ ] Try accessing without credentials
- [ ] Should redirect to login or show 401
- [ ] Try accessing with wrong credentials
- [ ] Should reject or show 403

### Session Management
- [ ] Log in to any protected page
- [ ] Check session token (in cookies or local storage)
- [ ] Verify token:
  - [ ] Is cryptographically random
  - [ ] Has reasonable expiration
  - [ ] Is HttpOnly (if cookie)
  - [ ] Is Secure (HTTPS only)

### API Authentication
- [ ] Check if API endpoints require authentication
- [ ] Try accessing without credentials
- [ ] Should return 401 Unauthorized
- [ ] Try accessing with invalid token
- [ ] Should return 401 or 403
