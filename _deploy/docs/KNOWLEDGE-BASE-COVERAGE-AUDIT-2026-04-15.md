## April 26, 2026 Addendum - Cross-Tribunal Evidence Status

Strict evidence table (confirmed/probable/unresolved):

- **WSIAT (Workers' Comp Appeals):** Tier A 74 (0.6%), Tier B 575 (5.0%), Tier C 10,781 (94.3%)
  - 65-73% worker success rate (official statistics)
  - Pre-existing condition cases: 1,522 (13.3% of dataset)
  - Chronic pain cases: 239
  
- **HRTO (Human Rights):** Tier A 4,618 (49.8%), Tier B 1 (0.0%), Tier C 4,650 (50.2%)
  - 73.5% abandonment rate
  - 70.1% of abandonments cite email delivery issues
  - Only 0.7% applicant victory rate among detected outcomes

- **ONSBT (ODSP/OW Appeals):** Tier A 494 (3.6%), Tier B 3,251 (23.6%), Tier C 10,053 (72.9%)
  - 67.4% grant rate in classified cases (2,524 granted vs 1,203 denied)
  - Person with disability determination: 10,477 cases (75.9% of dataset)
  - Pain-related cases: 3,542 (25.7%)
  - Overpayment allegations: 739 (5.4%)
  - Substantial impairment test: 6,813 cases (49.4%)

- **ONWSIB (WSIB Internal Reviews):** Tier A 1 (0.2%), Tier B 19 (4.1%), Tier C 443 (95.7%)
  - 89.5% probable grant rate (17 of 19 Tier B outcomes)
  - Work-related injury: 52 cases (12.1%)
   - Pre-existing condition: 31 cases (6.7%)
  - Knee/shoulder injuries most common (4.9% and 4.2%)
  - Very limited public data availability

**Total Dataset:** 35,928 tribunal decisions across four Ontario tribunals (2020-2026)

Proxy audit CI summary (Wilson 95%, sample-pack screening):

- ONWSIB Tier B error: 0.0% (0.0-16.8), Tier C missed-explicit: 0.0% (0.0-3.1)
- HRTO Tier B error: 0.0% (0.0-79.3), Tier C missed-explicit: 0.8% (0.1-4.6)
- ONWSIAT Tier B error: 0.0% (0.0-3.1), Tier C missed-explicit: 0.0% (0.0-3.1)
- ONSBT Tier B error: 0.0% (0.0-3.1), Tier C missed-explicit: 0.0% (0.0-3.1)

**Interpretation:** Keep Tier A and Tier B clearly separated in all knowledge base and template claims. Tier C volume remains the dominant data quality constraint across all tribunals except HRTO.

**New Knowledge Base Priorities:**

Based on ONSBT findings:
1. **ODSP Disability Definition Guide** (urgent - 75.9% of ONSBT cases)
2. **Substantial Impairment Test Explainer** (urgent - 49.4% of cases reference this standard)
3. **Pain Documentation for ODSP Appeals** (high - 25.7% of cases)
4. **Overpayment Defense Strategies** (medium - 5.4% of cases)
5. **Medical Verification Best Practices** (medium - 11.8% of cases)

Based on ONWSIB findings:
1. **WSIB Internal Review Strategy Guide** (medium - helps workers decide ONWSIB vs direct WSIAT)
2. **Pre-Existing Condition Early Defense** (medium - appears in 6.7% of ONWSIB, escalates to 13.3% at WSIAT)
3. **WSIB → ONWSIB → WSIAT Pathway Explainer** (high - workers need clarity on the full system)

### ❌ MISSING (NO Knowledge Base Articles)

| Injury Type | Cases | % | Priority | Why Missing? |
|-------------|-------|---|----------|--------------|
| **SHOULDER** | **1,391** | **12.2%** | **🔴 CRITICAL** | **Biggest injury type - epidemic-level occupational disease** |

## Appeal Template Coverage Analysis

### ✅ EXISTING TEMPLATES

| Template | Based On | Injury Coverage | Location |
|----------|----------|-----------------|----------|
| `pre-existing-appeal.md` | 96 cases | General pre-existing denials | `data/templates/` (app only) |
| `chronic-pain-appeal.md` | 186 cases | Chronic pain denials | `data/templates/` (app only) |
| `back-injury-appeal.md` | 830 cases | Back/lumbar injuries | `data/templates/` (app + website `_templates/`) |

**Problem:** Templates are NOT on website `data/` folder - only in app and website `_templates/` folder

---

### ❌ MISSING TEMPLATES

**Critical Gaps:**

1. **Shoulder injury appeal** (1,391 cases - 12.2%)
   - Should include: rotator cuff strategy, gradual onset argument, occupational disease angle
   
2. **Knee injury appeal** (845 cases - 7.4%, 20% denial rate)
   - Should include: *Kriz* threshold challenge, pre-existing osteoarthritis counter, functional baseline proof

3. **Mental health/PTSD appeal** (611 cases - 5.3%)
   - Should include: "psychotraumatic disability" terminology, discrete traumatic event documentation, separating anxiety from PTSD

4. **Occupational disease appeal** (cancer, respiratory, hearing loss)
   - Should include: presumptive coverage arguments, occupational medicine evidence, reverse onus strategy

5. **Reconsideration waiver letter** (389 cases - 3.4%)
   - Should explain why worker is skipping reconsideration (1.5 year delay) and going straight to tribunal

---

## File Organization Issues

### Inconsistent Locations:

**Knowledge Base:**
- Website: `data/knowledge-base/` (6 files, no index)
- Website: `_knowledge_base/` (duplicate? needs verification)
- App: `data/knowledge-base/` (7 files, includes index.md)

**Templates:**
- Website: `_templates/` (1 file found: back-injury)
- Website: `data/appeal-templates/` (mentioned in scripts, may be empty)
- App: `data/templates/` (3 files: pre-existing, chronic-pain, back-injury)

**Recommendation:** Consolidate to single locations:
- Website: `data/knowledge-base/` for KB, `data/templates/` for appeal letters
- App: Keep `data/knowledge-base/` and `data/templates/` synced with website

---

## Recommended Actions (Priority Order)

### 🔴 CRITICAL (Do First)

1. **Create shoulder injury knowledge base** (`shoulder-rotator-cuff-claims.md`)
   - 1,391 cases = 12.2% of ALL tribunal decisions
   - Include: rotator cuff tears, impingement, tendinitis patterns
   - Emphasize: Occupational disease angle, gradual onset strategy, deny "aging" excuse

2. **Create knee injury knowledge base** (`knee-injury-claims.md`)
   - 845 cases, 20% pre-existing denial rate
   - Include: meniscus tears, osteoarthritis battles, kneeling work
   - Emphasize: *Kriz* threshold, functional baseline, 20% systematic bias

3. **Create shoulder injury appeal template**
   - Most common denial: "gradual onset not an accident"
   - Counter: Occupational disease, cumulative trauma, repetitive strain

4. **Create knee injury appeal template**
   - Most common denial: "pre-existing osteoarthritis"
   - Counter: *Kriz* case, workplace significantly contributed, functional baseline

5. **Fix template deployment to website**
   - Copy all 3 templates from app `data/templates/` to website `data/templates/`
   - Ensure published by Jekyll (not in exclude list)

### 🟠 HIGH (Do Within Week)

6. **Create neck/whiplash knowledge base** (485 cases, 4.2%)
7. **Create wrist/carpal tunnel knowledge base** (376 cases, 3.3%)
8. **Create concussion/TBI knowledge base** (183 cases, 1.6%)
9. **Create mental health appeal template** (611 cases, 5.3%)
10. **Create occupational disease appeal template** (cancer, respiratory, hearing)

### 🟡 MEDIUM (Do Within 2 Weeks)

11. **Create ankle injury knowledge base** (272 cases)
12. **Create elbow injury knowledge base** (219 cases)
13. **Create hand injury knowledge base** (186 cases)
14. **Create reconsideration waiver template** (skip 1.5 year delay)
15. **Create modified duties rejection letter** (unsuitable work)

### 🟢 LOW (Do When Time Permits)

16. **Create hip injury knowledge base** (124 cases)
17. **Create hearing loss knowledge base** (38 cases)
18. **Create employer cost relief challenge letter** (97 co-occurrences with pre-existing)
19. **Update all existing KB articles with NEW 98,992-case statistics** (currently based on older 1,204-case dataset)

---

## Statistics Update Needed

**Problem:** Existing knowledge base articles cite OLD 2025-2026 data (1,204 cases)  
**Solution:** Update ALL articles with NEW 2020-2026 data (98,992 cases)

**Example Updates Needed:**

**Old (current):**
> "Low back pain appears in 194 cases, based on 1,204 tribunal decisions analyzed."

**New (should be):**
> "Low back pain appears in 390 cases (3.4%), based on 98,992 tribunal decisions (2020-2026). Recent detective-mode analysis reveals back injuries have 19% pre-existing denial rate—proving systematic bias."

**Files Needing Updates:**
- [ ] `low-back-pain-claims.md` - Update case counts, add 19% pre-existing rate
- [ ] `chronic-pain-claims.md` - Update to 172 cases, add mental health conflation pattern (107 cases)
- [ ] `pre-existing-conditions.md` - Update to 1,522 cases (13.3% - #2 denial tactic!)
- [ ] `psychotraumatic-disability.md` - Update to 611 cases, add 5x undercount vs. "stress"
- [ ] `permanent-impairment-rating.md` - Update to 818 cases (7.2%)
- [ ] `fibromyalgia-claims.md` - Update case counts

## Cross-Reference Integration

**NEW detective blog posts should link to knowledge base:**

**From blog posts:**
- "Learn more about shoulder injuries → [KB article]"
- "Fighting pre-existing denials? → [KB article + appeal template]"
- "Keyword decoder found 'psychotraumatic disability'? → [mental health KB]"

**From knowledge base:**
- "See full statistical analysis → [Detective blog post]"
- "Download appeal template → [shoulder-appeal.md]"
- "Interactive keyword search → [Network visualization]"

## Website vs. App Sync Status

| Resource Type | Website Status | App Status | Sync Status |
|---------------|---------------|------------|-------------|
| Knowledge Base (6 core files) | ✅ In `data/knowledge-base/` | ✅ In `data/knowledge-base/` | ✅ **SYNCED** (updated with statistical banners) |
| Knowledge Base Index | ❌ Missing | ✅ Exists | ⚠️ **PARTIAL** |
| Appeal Templates (3) | ⚠️ In `_templates/` only | ✅ In `data/templates/` | ❌ **NOT SYNCED** |
| NEW Statistical Findings | ✅ In blog posts | ❌ Not integrated | ⚠️ **NEEDS INTEGRATION** |

---
