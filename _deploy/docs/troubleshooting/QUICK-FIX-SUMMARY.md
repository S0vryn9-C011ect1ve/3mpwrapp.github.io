## ⚠️ 3. Logo Update - NEEDS YOUR HELP

**ISSUE**: New logo image was never saved to the file system.

### What Happened:
- ✅ Old logo backed up
- ✅ PWA icons generated (12 files)
- ❌ New logo image never replaced old one
- Result: Website still shows old logo

### Current Status:
```
assets/empowrapp-logo.png      = OLD LOGO (Oct 4)
assets/empowrapp-logo-old.png  = SAME OLD LOGO (backup)
```

Both files are identical! New logo was never saved.

### How to Fix:

**Option 1: Re-attach the Logo Image (I'll Handle It)**

Just re-attach your new logo image (power button with hands design) in your next message, and I'll:
1. Save it as `assets/empowrapp-logo.png`
2. Regenerate all 12 PWA icons from it
3. Commit and push
4. Done in 2 minutes!

**Option 2: Upload Manually**
1. Open VS Code
2. Replace `assets/empowrapp-logo.png` with your new image
3. Run in terminal: `node scripts/generate-icons.js`
4. Commit and push:
   ```powershell
   git add assets/
   git commit -m "feat: Update logo to power button with hands design"
   git push origin main
   ```

**Option 3: Update Later**
- Current logo works fine
- No urgency
- Update when convenient
