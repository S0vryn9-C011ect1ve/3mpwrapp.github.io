## 🔴 PRIORITY 1: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages (5 minutes)

**Why First:** Activates your security headers, makes site faster globally.

### Steps:
1. Go to: https://pages.cloudflare.com/
2. Sign up (no credit card)
3. Connect GitHub: `3mpwrApp/3mpwrapp.github.io`
4. Build settings:
   - Command: `bundle exec jekyll build`
   - Output: `_site`
   - Environment: `JEKYLL_ENV=production`

**See detailed guide:** `CLOUDFLARE-QUICK-START.md`

**Result:** Site is faster, more secure, scales to millions of users for free.

## 🟠 PRIORITY 2: Add Microsoft Clarity Code (5 minutes)

You have the tracking code - let's add it!

**Provide your Clarity code and I'll add it to `_includes/custom-head.html`**

It should look like:
```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">
  (function(c,l,a,r,i,t,y){
    c[a]=c[a]||function(){(c[a].q=c[a].q||[]).push(arguments)};
    t=l.createElement(r);t.async=1;t.src="https://www.clarity.ms/tag/"+i;
    y=l.getElementsByTagName(r)[0];y.parentNode.insertBefore(t,y);
  })(window, document, "clarity", "script", "YOUR_PROJECT_ID");
</script>
```

**Result:** See exactly how users interact with site. Find usability issues.

## 🟡 PRIORITY 3: Set Up Essential Monitoring (30 minutes)

### A. UptimeRobot (10 min)

   - `https://3mpwrapp.ca` (after Cloudflare setup)
   - `https://3mpwrapp.github.io/user-guide/`
4. Set alert email
5. Create public status page (free subdomain)

**Result:** Get notified if site goes down.

### B. Verify Google Search Console (5 min)
1. Google verification file already uploaded! ✅
2. Go to: https://search.google.com/search-console
3. Add property: `3mpwrapp.github.io`
4. Choose "HTML file" verification method
5. Click "Verify" (file is already there!)
6. Submit sitemap: `https://3mpwrapp.github.io/sitemap.xml`

**Result:** Track how people find you, optimize for search.

### C. Cloudflare Web Analytics (5 min)
