1. **Opening Hook** (200 words)
   - Start with YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE with this problem
   - First-person: "I remember when I couldn't...", "I know what it's like to..."
   - The PAIN: What happens when you don't have this tool

   - Why the current system fails disabled/injured workers

     * Government bureaucracy
   - "This is what changes when you have the right tool..."

5. **Accessibility Promise** (400 words)
   - "I built this for EVERYONE—including screen reader users, people with low vision, voice control users"

WRITING STYLE (MANDATORY):

EXAMPLE OPENING (match this energy):
"I was denied WSIB right after they said I'd reached maximum recovery. They decided I was 'recovered' even though I couldn't work. I went on Ontario Works, then ODSP, now CPP-D. I spent 5 years in that system—5 years of lived experience with every broken process this app fixes. I built Evidence Locker because I know what it's like when the paperwork defeats you before the system even looks at your case."
