## Know Your Energy Before You Need It

Managing a disability often means managing limited energy. Phase 6 of 3mpwrApp introduces AI-powered energy forecasting that learns your patterns and predicts your best times.

### What's Energy Forecasting?

Think of your energy like a battery. Some days you wake up charged. Other days you're running on fumes. 3mpwrApp learns YOUR pattern and predicts:

- ⚡ **When you'll have the most energy** (best for big tasks)
- 🔋 **When you'll have the least energy** (time to rest)
- 📊 **24-hour energy predictions** (plan your entire day)
- 🎯 **Optimal times for activities** (when you're strongest)

### How Machine Learning Helps

The app analyzes your patterns across:
- Your activity history
- When you use which tools
- Your mood and wellness tracking
- Your sleep and rest patterns
- Your symptom fluctuations

Then it uses AI algorithms to predict: **"Based on your patterns, you'll have peak energy at 2 PM tomorrow."**

### Smart Notifications That Actually Work

Instead of bothering you randomly, smart notifications:

✅ **Schedule for YOUR peak times** - Messages arrive when you have energy to read and act  
✅ **Learn what works** - App tests different times to find your optimal window  
✅ **Respect your capacity** - Fewer notifications during low-energy periods  
✅ **Adapt over time** - Gets smarter as it learns more about you  

### Weekly Wellness Reports

Every week, you get a comprehensive summary:
- 📈 Energy trends (are you improving or declining?)
- 😊 Mood patterns (what affects your mental health?)
- 🛠️ Tool usage insights (what helps most?)
- 🏆 Achievements (celebrate your wins!)
- ⭐ Wellness score (overall wellbeing snapshot)

### Real-World Example

> Maria uses a wheelchair and experiences pain that's worse in mornings.
>
> **Old way:** Tried to schedule important calls at 9 AM, but was always too sore.
>
> **With 3mpwrApp:** Energy forecast says her peak times are 2-4 PM. She now schedules calls then and gets way more done. Notifications about benefits appointments come at 1 PM when she has time to read and respond.
>
> **Result:** More accomplishments, less frustration, better energy management.

### Privacy First

All energy prediction happens **on your device**:
- Your data never leaves your phone
- No cloud processing of personal patterns
- You control what you share
- Delete anytime, no questions asked

### Getting Started with Energy Forecasting

1. Enable in Settings → Wellness → Energy Forecasting
2. Start with the Energy Coins tool (tracks your daily capacity)
3. Use mood tracking for a few days
4. Watch as the app learns your patterns
5. See 24-hour predictions appear on your dashboard

    title: 'How-To: Using the Disability Wizard for Personalized Recommendations',
    type: 'howto',
    day: 3, // Wednesday
    excerpt: 'Discover your best tools first. The Disability Wizard learns your needs and suggests exactly what you need, when you need it.',
    content: `
## Let AI Learn Your Needs

The Disability Wizard is like a smart personal assistant that learns your disability, energy patterns, and preferences—then recommends the perfect tool at the right time.

### What is the Disability Wizard?

Every time you open 3mpwrApp, you'll see three personalized recommendations:

- 🎯 **Today's Feature** - Highest priority for you right now
- ⭐ **Energy-Matched Tool** - What you can actually do today (not just tomorrow)
- 💡 **Hidden Gem** - A feature you might not have discovered yet

Each includes:
- Simple explanation of what it does
- How much energy it takes (🟢 Low / 🟠 Medium / 🔴 High)
- Time estimate (usually 2-15 minutes)
- Why it's recommended for YOU

### Step 1: Set Up Your Profile

**Takes 3 minutes:**

1. Open 3mpwrApp → Settings → Disability Wizard
2. Select your disability type (or multiple if relevant)
   - Physical disabilities
   - Neurodivergent (ADHD, autism, etc.)
   - Cognitive/learning disabilities
   - Mental health conditions
   - Chronic illness
   - Sensory disabilities
3. Choose your energy patterns
   - Morning person, evening person, or variable?
   - Generally high energy, low energy, or fluctuating?
4. Select accessibility needs
   - Screen reader, high contrast, large text, etc.
5. Tap Save

**That's it!** Your wizard is now personalized.

### Step 2: Let It Learn Your Patterns

The wizard gets smarter the more you use it. After a few days:

- It learns when YOU typically open the app
- It sees which tools you actually use
- It notices what types of tasks you complete
- It tracks your energy patterns over time

**After 1 week:** Recommendations become much more accurate  
**After 1 month:** Wizard knows you better than you know yourself

### Step 3: Follow the Recommendations

Try the suggestions it offers. You don't have to use them, but:

- ✅ **If it helps:** Tell the app "That was perfect" → recommendations improve
- ✅ **If it's not for you:** Just skip it → Wizard learns what you don't need
- ✅ **If you're not sure:** Read the description → You might discover something useful

### Real Example

**Meet Jamie:**
- Autism + chronic pain + ADHD
- Mornings are rough, productive from 2-5 PM
- Uses a screen reader
- Struggles with decision fatigue

**What the Wizard recommends:**

> **Tuesday Morning (11 AM)**
> 
> 🟢 Low Energy, 3 minutes
> 
> "Mood Reflection - You usually track mood in the morning. Take 60 seconds?"
>
> Why: You've been consistent with daily reflections
> What's next: Suggesting peer support after this

> **Tuesday Afternoon (2 PM)**
>
> 🟡 Medium Energy, 8 minutes
>
> "AI Translator - Someone shared a confusing benefits letter with you"
>
> Why: Your peak energy time + you've used this tool 4 times before
> What's next: Can save to your Evidence Locker

> **Tuesday Evening (4:30 PM)**
>
> 🟡 Medium Energy, 10 minutes
>
> "Disability Wizard Profile Check - Updating your patterns"
>
> Why: It's learning your real preferences based on what you actually use
> What's next: Tomorrow's recommendations will be even better

### Tips for Getting the Most Out of It

✅ **Open the app regularly** - More usage = better learning  
✅ **Try recommended tools** - Even if unsure, you might love it  
✅ **Give feedback** - "That helped" / "Not for me" improves recommendations  
✅ **Update your profile** - If your energy changes, tell the wizard  
✅ **Check different times** - You might get different recommendations at different times  

### What If Recommendations Aren't Working?

**The wizard learns from what you do, not just what you click.** If recommendations miss the mark:

1. **Update your profile** - Go to Settings, refresh your preferences
2. **Tell the wizard directly** - "I prefer..." feedback helps
3. **Reset and restart** - Sometimes a fresh start helps
4. **Try advanced setup** - More detailed profile = better predictions

### Privacy & Your Data

- ✅ All learning happens on YOUR device
- ✅ Your preferences never leave your phone
- ✅ No cloud processing of personal patterns
- ✅ Delete anytime with one click
- ✅ Complete control over your data

### Machine Learning That Understands Disability

Our AI doesn't just serve everyone the same. It learns:

- **Your disability type** - Customize features for your specific needs
- **Your energy patterns** - Predict when you'll have capacity
- **Your communication style** - Text, voice, visual, or mixed
- **Your accessibility tools** - Screen reader? Adjust automatically
- **Your pain/symptom patterns** - Suggest breaks when needed
- **Your preferences** - Remember what works for you

### Real-World Accessibility Examples

**Marcus uses a screen reader (blindness):**
> The entire app works perfectly with JAWS. All buttons announce their purpose. Images have descriptions. Lists are properly marked up. He navigates via keyboard alone. The app says "New email received" instead of just playing a sound.

**Priya has ADHD and dyslexia:**
> She uses OpenDyslexic font with 3 pixels letter spacing and mint overlay (Irlen support). The app remembers these settings. She uses simplified mode to reduce choices. Auto-save means she never loses notes mid-thought. The Disability Wizard suggests time-blocking tools perfect for ADHD.

**David has chronic pain (physical disability):**
> Energy Coins help him plan realistic days. Voice input means he doesn't have to type when his hands hurt. Large buttons are easier to tap. The app predicts his pain patterns and suggests rest times.

**Sierra is Deaf:**
> All videos have captions. Notifications show as visual alerts. She communicates in the community using text. The app never requires voice.

### Technical Standards We Meet

- ✅ **WCAG 2.1 AA** (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Level AA)
- ✅ **ADA Compliance** (Americans with Disabilities Act)
- ✅ **Section 508** (US federal accessibility standard)
- ✅ **AODA Compliance** (Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act)
- ✅ **Canadian Accessibility Standards** (CAP - in development)

### What "Accessible-First" Really Means

Traditional approach: Build it, then add accessibility  
**Our approach:** Accessibility is the foundation

This means:
1. **Design for disability first** - Not as an afterthought
2. **Test with real users** - People actually using assistive tech
3. **Iterate based on feedback** - Continuous improvement
4. **Privacy as default** - Not opt-in
5. **Redundant communication** - Text + visual + audio when relevant

### Accessibility Settings - Your Control

[Open Accessibility Settings →](/accessibility-settings)

Customize:
- Font size, family, spacing
- Color contrast and overlays
