Injured workers in Ontario are being cut off benefits at 65—or sooner if injured at 63+. It's outdated and unfair.

Injured workers in Ontario are being cut off benefits at age 65—or sooner if injured at 63 or older. **It's outdated and unfair.**

Many people work well past 65. Why should injured workers be penalized for wanting the same?

Ontario's WSIB rules cut off Loss of Earnings benefits at age 65—no matter if you planned to keep working.

**Workers injured at 63 or older? As little as 2 years of compensation.**

This is **age discrimination**, plain and simple.

📊 **Statistics Canada (2024):** More than 421,000 Ontarians over 65 are employed. Nearly 164,000 are over 70.

**The Problem:**
- Injured workers' LOE benefits cut at age 65
- Workers injured at 63+ get as little as 2 years compensation
- Doesn't reflect today's workforce (many work past 65)

**The Solution:**
Email your MPP demanding reform. We've written the letter—you just need to add your name.

**What We're Asking For:**
✅ Compensation until age 70 (if injured before 65)
✅ 5 years minimum (if injured at 65+)
✅ Extended coverage where evidence shows worker would've continued
