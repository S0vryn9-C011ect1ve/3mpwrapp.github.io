## What Is Beta Testing?

**Beta testing = helping find and fix bugs before release.**

### Your Role

You help by:
1. Using new features
2. Testing workflows
3. Finding bugs
4. Testing accessibility
5. Testing performance
6. Reporting issues
7. Giving feedback

### What You'll Find

Beta versions often have:
- ✅ New features to try
- ⚠️ Sometimes crashes or bugs (that's why we need testers!)
- ⚠️ Performance issues (slow loading, battery drain)
- ⚠️ Accessibility barriers (harder to use with screen reader, etc.)

**Your job:** Find these issues and report them so we can fix them before the public release.

### What You Won't Find

- Finished documentation (we're writing it with you!)
- Perfect performance (that's what you help us fix)
- All features (some are still in progress)

## Accessibility Testing Checklist

**Test 3MPWRAPP in all three display modes:**

### Light Mode Testing

- [ ] All text is clearly readable (dark gray or black on white)
- [ ] All links are blue and underlined
- [ ] Headings stand out from body text
- [ ] No text is faint or hard to read
- [ ] All buttons are clearly clickable
- [ ] Focus indicators (blue ring) are visible when using Tab key

**What to watch for:**
- Gray text on white background (too low contrast)
- Links that blend into surrounding text
- Text that's faint or barely visible

### Dark Mode Testing

- [ ] All text is clearly readable (white or light gray on dark background)
- [ ] All links are light blue and underlined
- [ ] Headings stand out from body text
- [ ] No text is faint or hard to read
- [ ] All buttons are clearly clickable
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible

**What to watch for:**
- Any text that becomes faint in dark mode
- Links that disappear or become invisible
- Buttons with dark text on dark backgrounds

### High Contrast Mode Testing

- [ ] All text is pure black on white (maximum contrast)
- [ ] All links are pure blue with underlines
- [ ] Headings are bold and prominent
- [ ] All buttons have thick black borders
- [ ] No color is used alone to show meaning
- [ ] Focus indicators are thick and visible

**What to watch for:**
- Gray colors (should be pure black or white)
- Color-only coding (e.g., red button for error with no text label)
- Thin borders or indicators

### Screen Reader Testing (VoiceOver/TalkBack)

**If you use a screen reader:**

- [ ] All buttons have descriptive labels (not just "Button 1")
- [ ] Form fields are labeled
- [ ] Instructions are spoken clearly
- [ ] Screen reader announces headings correctly
- [ ] Lists are announced as lists
- [ ] Links announce their destination
- [ ] Images have alt text descriptions

**What to watch for:**
- Unlabeled buttons (just say "button" with no purpose)
- Form fields with no labels
- Images with no descriptions
- Tables without header rows

### Keyboard Navigation Testing

- [ ] Can access all buttons and links with Tab
- [ ] Can activate buttons with Enter key
- [ ] Can cancel with Escape key
- [ ] Tab order makes sense (left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
- [ ] Focus ring is always visible

**What to watch for:**
- Keyboard can't reach certain buttons
- Tab order jumps around randomly
- Focus ring disappears or is hard to see
- Can't use Tab+Enter to do everything

### Text Scaling Testing

Test with text scaled to 150% and 200%:
- [ ] All text is still readable
- [ ] Text doesn't overlap or clip
- [ ] Buttons are still clickable
- [ ] Layout adjusts properly
- [ ] Horizontal scrolling isn't required (ideally)

**What to watch for:**
- Text that gets cut off
- Text that overlaps other text
- Buttons that become unreachable
- Layout that breaks

### Dyslexia-Friendly Font Testing

If you use dyslexic-friendly fonts:
- [ ] Font is actually different (not just smaller)
- [ ] Letters are easier to distinguish
- [ ] Reading feels easier
- [ ] All app features work with font enabled

**What to watch for:**
- Font doesn't actually change
- Font makes things harder to read
